# DaVinci
Proof of concept for an intelligent home system

Wolfram Alpha is capable of generating images and tables full of relevant statistics, calculating and computing expert-level answers, and comparing structures, concepts, places, people, etc.

Google's curated summary results utilize hundreds of sources to give you fact based summary responses to your questions. You can summarize concepts, books, movies, or ask a huge variety of questions.

Even very niche questions...

# Motivation
I built Da Vinci as a hack-a-thon project with the prompt, "Build something that makes the world a better place by means of education." But I also built this project because I saw an opportunity to scale up an idea to something much larger. [[Computational Intelligence](https://github.com/eriknahmad/Computational-Intelligence)]</br>Inspired by Iron Man's Jarvis, I built a basic GUI using the TKinter Framework to answer questions using Wolfram Alpha's Computational Knowledge Engine and Google's curated summary results. I plan to refactor some code and then start implementation of new features such as Home Control with Raspberry Pi, Home Server, Security System, Stock and Cryptocurrency Price Watcher, etc. The end goal is an open source, intelligent, and multifunctional home system.



# How to use?
Get a Wolfram Alpha API Key and use an IDE to:
- Insert API Key into the DaVinci.py script.
- Install all necessary libraries and dependencies. (I use [Replit](https://replit.com/~) for automatic imports)
- Run the script and ask a fact based question
